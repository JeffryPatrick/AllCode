In my college for Mini Project, we developed a website for Home Automation Guidance.

We have used the fundamental concepts of Web development and for Styling purpose we used BootStrap FrameWork.

The idea of the project is to give a clear understanding on Home Automation and the information
of the products that are used.

We have developed four basic modules they are,
    1. Smart
    2. Concepts
    3. Support
    4. Shop

First two modules, we feed the general information about Automation Concepts.

In Support module, we give technical knowledge about Automation with images and video tutorials.

At last, Shop module shows the product, which are available in the E-Commerce Website.
